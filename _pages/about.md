Hi! My name is Shin Sun. I work as a research assistant at Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University. My research interest
lies in the intersection of Quantum Information Theory, Physical Chemistry, and Mathematics. Therefore, I created this blog as
a place to share the topics I find interesting, and explain them based on my personal knowledge. Please feel free to contact me
if you have anything want to discuss. (My email address is at the bottom of the page)
